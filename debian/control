Description: OpenVINO™ Toolkit - Deep Learning Deployment Toolkit
 OpenVINO™ toolkit, short for Open Visual Inference and Neural network
 Optimization toolkit, provides developers with improved neural network
 performance on a variety of Intel® processors and helps them further
 unlock cost-effective, real-time vision applications.
 .
 The toolkit enables deep learning inference and easy heterogeneous
 execution across multiple Intel® platforms (CPU, Intel® Processor Graphics)
 —providing implementations across cloud architectures to edge devices.
 This open source distribution provides flexibility and availability to
 the developer community to innovate deep learning and AI solutions.
